## Frequently Asked Questions

> _This FAQ provides general information about the term "Access Control" but most definitions are specific to AccessControl.js - how the library is implemented._

### What is "Access Control"?

In information security, **Access Control** is selective restriction of **_access_** to a **_resource_**.

AccessControl.js ...

-   defines act of accessing by "actions".
-   provides an abstract layer between the application logic and the requested resource and action.

### What is an "action"?

AccessControl.js defines "accessing" by [CRUD][crud] actions (`create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`). It does not specify **how an _action_ is performed** on the _resource_. But rather, decides **whether the _action_ can be performed** by the accessing party: **_role_**.

Below is a typical match of AC actions to actual HTTP and database operations:

| AccessControl.js | REST/HTTP        | Database |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| **`CREATE`**     | `POST`           | `INSERT` |
| **`READ`**       | `GET`            | `SELECT` |
| **`UPDATE`**     | `PUT` or `PATCH` | `UPDATE` |
| **`DELETE`**     | `DELETE`         | `DELETE` |

Most of the time this might be the case; but depending on the context or resource; you could map these actions to completely different operations.

-   a **`CREATE`** might mean sending an SMS to a user.
-   a **`READ`** might mean downloading a file.
-   a **`DELETE`** in AccessControl logic might mean an **`UPDATE`** in database.  
    e.g. setting a table field, named `isDeleted` to `1` (soft-delete).

and so on...

### What is a "resource"?

A **resource** identifies a unique thing (noun) that's named/referenced and being accessed. This is typically an abstract definition. What the resource actually is; and how that resource is implemented is a **design decision**, the developer makes.

Depending on the context; a resource can be a _document_, a _database record_, an _apple_, the _relationship of two people_, _fear of dark_, a _cat breed_, a _cat_, [etc...][res-examples]

When defining a resource for AccessControl, the developer should decide whether that _"thing"_...

-   is semantically unique (different than other defined resources),
-   requires a distinguished control of access.

For example:

-   We have a database table called `accounts`.
-   The `accounts` table has fields such as `firstName`, `lastName`, `email` and `pwd`.
-   In our application context, a user can modify `firstName` and `lastName` freely. But we'll have a separate page for changing the password and/or email address; which will prompt for current password.

In this scenario, we may have two resources: `account` and `credentials`

```js
ac.grant('user')
    .createAny('account') // create new account with all attributes
    .updateOwn('account', ['*', '!pwd', '!email']) // update own account except password and email
    .updateOwn('credentials'); // update own credentials (password and email)
```

### How do you define a resource?

In AccessControl.js, a resource is defined whenever a permission is granted or denied for the first time, for that resource.

```js
ac.can('monkey').createOwn('banana').granted; // false
ac.hasResource('banana'); // false
ac.grant('monkey').createOwn('banana'); // resource is defined for the first time
ac.hasResource('banana'); // true
ac.can('monkey').createOwn('banana').granted; // true
```

### Can I use AccessControl.js with a database? How?

(MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc..)

AccessControl.js is not coupled with any kind of database system. Actually it's unrelated. It only grants or denies access to a resource. The rest depends on your application's logic and decisions you (the developer) make.

Here is a scenario;

-   Application logic: _"Users can assign folders to users."_  
    In the backend, this is done by creating a record in a relational table: `folderUsers`
-   So, we have 3 tables in our database: `users`, `folders` and `folderUsers`
-   The relation is established by two fields, in `folderUsers` table:

    -   `folderId` ( foreign-key: `folders.id` )
    -   `userId` ( foreign-key: `users.id` )

-   In AccessControl, we'll represent this resource as `"fu-relation"`.  
    And we'll restrict access for `create` actions performed on this resource.

In this case, we have 4 options.

By **creating** a **`fu-relation`** resource, **a user of this role**, can assign...

| #   | Permission                                      | covers  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1   | ... **own** `folder` to itself (**own** `user`) |         |
| 2   | ... **any** `folder` to itself (**own** `user`) | 1       |
| 3   | ... **own** `folder` to **any** `user`          | 1       |
| 4   | ... **any** `folder` to **any** `user`          | 1, 2, 3 |

When you grant or check for a permission via `.createOwn()`, you (the developer) should decide what **_own_** stands for. So I will make the following **decision** as the developer.

In **this context**:

-   **own** `fu-relation` means _"**own** `folder` to **any** `user`"_ (option # 3)
-   **any** `fu-relation` means _"**any** `folder` to **any** `user`"_ (option #4)

With this **decision**:

-   I don't need to check whether the assigned-user is current (_own_) user.
-   I need to check whether the assigned-folder is _own_ `folder` (implied resource) of the current user.

First I'll define 2 roles; `user` and `admin`; and grant access permissions accordingly:

```js
ac.grant('user')
    .createOwn('fu-relation')
    .grant('admin')
    .createAny('fu-relation');
```

So when the resource is accessed, I'll check these permissions, and restrict or allow the request:

```js
// psuedo (sync) code

var role = session.role; // role of the requesting user: 'user' or 'admin'
var userIdToBeAssigned = request.params.userId; // can be any user id
var folderId = request.params.folderId;

// First check if current role can create "ANY" fu-relation. (ANY > OWN)
var permission = ac.can(role).createAny('fu-relation');

// if not granted, check if current role can create "OWN" fu-relation:
if (permission.granted === false) {
    // Determine whether the implied resource (folder) is "owned"
    // by the current user. This is app's responsibility, not AC's.
    if (session.userId === getFolder(folderId).userId) {
        // We made sure that the implied resource is "owned" by this user.
        // Now we can ask AccessControl permission for performing
        // the action on the target resource:
        permission = ac.can(role).createOwn('fu-relation');
    }
}

// Finally, execute the operation if allowed:
if (permission.granted) {
    // whatever app-logic here.. e.g.:
    db.insert({
        table: folderUsers,
        row: {
            folderId: request.params.folderId,
            userId: userIdToBeAssigned,
        },
    });
} else {
    // forbidden
    console.log('Access Denied!');
}
```

### What to do when AccessControl.js throws an error?

Granting permissions for valuable resources and managing access levels for user roles... This is a highly sensitive context; in which mostly, any failure or exception becomes critical. So in any case, an `AccessControlError` is thrown right away. **No silent errors**!

**In Development:**
Hard-test your application with all or most possible use cases, in terms of access management and control. If you see any `AccessControlError` thrown you should definitely fix it immediately. Because this typically indicates that your grants model either has a logical or technical flaw.

**In Production:**
You did all your tests in development but still, if a caught exception is an instance of `AccessControlError`, I highly recommend the host application should be gracefully shut down when in production.

For details on errors thrown, see [AccessControl Errors][errors] section.
